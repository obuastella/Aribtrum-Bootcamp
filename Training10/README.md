### ERC20 Token Smart Contract

This repository contains a Solidity smart contract implementing the ERC20 token standard. ERC20 tokens are fungible tokens that comply with a set of rules and interfaces, allowing them to be compatible with various decentralized applications (DApps), exchanges, and wallets within the Ethereum ecosystem.

### Introduction to ERC20 Tokens

**ERC20**: ERC20 is a technical standard used for Ethereum-based smart contracts. It defines a set of rules and functions that Ethereum tokens must follow to be considered ERC20-compliant. ERC20 tokens are fungible, meaning that each token is identical and interchangeable with every other token of the same type.

**ERC721**: ERC721 is another Ethereum token standard, commonly known as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Unlike ERC20 tokens, ERC721 tokens are unique and non-interchangeable, representing ownership of digital or physical assets such as art, collectibles, and real estate.

### Features

- **Token Deployment**: Deploy the ERC20 token smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Token Transfer**: Transfer tokens between Ethereum addresses.
- **Token Balance Inquiry**: Check the token balance of a specific Ethereum address.
- **Token Approval**: Approve token transfers on behalf of other addresses.
- **Event Logging**: Log important token-related events such as transfers and approvals.

### Getting Started

To deploy the ERC20 token smart contract, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the Solidity smart contract using a compatible compiler.
3. Deploy the compiled contract to the Ethereum blockchain using a suitable Ethereum client or development environment.

### Usage

Once deployed, interact with the ERC20 token smart contract using Ethereum wallets, decentralized applications (DApps), or custom scripts. Use the provided functions to transfer tokens, check balances, approve token transfers, and monitor token-related events.
